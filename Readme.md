## Java-based TCP Echo Server

This is a TCP-based application that is implemented in two programs, namely a client program and a server program.

The client can be used to send a line of text to the server. The echo server would then modify the received line of text, capitlizing its letters, and then send the modified line back to the client.

## Technologies Used

Java was used to develop the multi-threaded server.

## How to run the code

### Server:

To launch the server, start a command prompt window and then go to the directory housing the code.

In that directory, type: java TCPServer and then press enter.

### Client:

To execute the client, start a command prompt window and then head to the directory containing the code.

In the directory, type:
java TCPClient message to send to server
